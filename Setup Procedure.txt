1. Download the latest Raspbian image. I chose the one WITHOUT the "recommended software".
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

1.5. Burn image onto an SD card. Use BalenaEtcher or another img burning utility. 
https://www.balena.io/etcher/

2. In the boot directory, add a file named "ssh.txt".
sudo nano ssh.txt
CTRL O
CTRL X
3. In the bood directory, add a file called "wpa_supplicant.conf"
sudo nano wpa_supplicant.conf

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=US

network={
     ssid="Your network name/SSID"
     psk="Your WPA/WPA2 security key"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

4. Power on the Pi. And SSH into it from another machine
ssh pi@raspberrypi
password: raspberry

5. Change the password
pwd NEWPASSWORD

6. Enable VNC server and the 1-Wire protocol
sudo raspi-config
>interfaces>1-Wire

7. Determine IP address
ifconfig

8. Logout of the pi/SSH session
exit

9. Send your files to the pi with Secure Copy. You can also leave the destination path as just "~" and move them manually later. 
scp /path/to/file/file.py pi@raspberrypi:~/path/to/send/

10. Download the relevant VNC client for your machine. 
https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/

11. Open the VNC viewer and find your pi at the IP you determined previously

12. Applications>Raspberry Pi Config. Enable VNC and change the default resolution. Reboot and re-connect via VNC.

13. Run the reactor control from the terminal
python3 ReactorControl.py
